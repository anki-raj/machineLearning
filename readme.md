# Building Machine learning models

This repository contains intuition about the machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing and building machine learning models.

  ###### Libraries required:
    numpy
    pandas
    sklearn
    matplotlib

  #### Data preprocessing

  Does the required preprocessing of the datasets
  
  ###### Steps to be performed
    1. Import all the libraries
    2. Import the dataset
    3. replace the null values to the mean of other values
    4. Encode the categorical variables
    5. Split the dataset to train and test sets
    6. Feature scaling
  
  #### Classifier
  Builds a logistic regression classifier of a dataset to classify if a person will buy a car or not.
  The model predicts the output based on the age and salary of the person.

  ###### Steps to be performed
  	1. Do the required pre-processing
  	2. Fit logistic regression to the training set
  	3. predict the test set results
  	4. Make a confusion matrix to find accuracy
  	5. Visualize it on graph
